## Portfolio Projects

In this section I will list data analytics projects briefly describing the technology stack used to solve cases.


## Machine Learning Projects

| Project Name | Description | Skills |
|----------|----------|----------|
| [Breast Cancer Classification](https://github.com/OnyiChi/Data-Science-Project/blob/main/machine_learning/classification/Breast_Cancer_Classification.ipynb)  | The breast cancer classification study employed logistic regression to discern between malignant and benign tumors using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset. After preprocessing and visualization, the dataset was split into training and testing sets, with the model achieving an accuracy score of 95.32% on the test data. The confusion matrix revealed a high number of true positives and true negatives, with minimal false positives and false negatives. Precision, recall, and the F1 score were also computed, yielding values of 96.92%, 94.44%, and 95.66%, respectively. These evaluation metrics collectively indicate the model's strong performance in accurately classifying breast cancer tumors, with high precision in avoiding false positives and high recall in detecting true positives.| Data preprocessing, Matplotlib and Searbon data visualization, Logistic regression, Scikit-learn library |
| [Breast Cancer Classification](https://github.com/OnyiChi/Data-Science-Project/blob/main/machine_learning/classification/Breast_Cancer_Classification.ipynb) | Row 2, Col 2 | Row 2, Col 3 |
| [Mall Customer Segmentation](https://github.com/OnyiChi/Data-Science-Project/tree/main/machine_learning/clustering/Mall_Customers_Segmentation) | This project involves analyzing customer data to identify distinct segments based on age, annual income, and spending score. Through exploratory data analysis and clustering techniques, including the K-Means algorithm, five customer segments were identified, highlighting varying patterns in spending behavior and income levels. The results reveal key insights into customer demographics and spending habits, enabling more targeted marketing strategies| Data preprocessing, visualization using libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn, and machine learning clustering methods. |
| [Movie Recommendation System](https://github.com/OnyiChi/Data-Science-Project/tree/main/machine_learning/recommendation) | The recommendation system presented utilizes cosine similarity to suggest movies to users based on their input. Upon receiving the name of a movie from the user, the system calculates the similarity between that movie and all others in the dataset, considering attributes such as genres, keywords, cast, and directors. The movies with the highest similarity scores are then recommended to the user. Through this approach, the system effectively identifies movies that share similar characteristics with the user's input, providing tailored recommendations. The results of the recommendation process are displayed to the user, listing the suggested movies ranked by their similarity scores. This allows users to discover new movies that align with their preferences and interests | Data preprocesing, TF-IDF Vectorization, Cosine similarity, Python libraries such as numpy, pandas, and scikit-learn for data manipulation, analysis, and machine learning tasks |
